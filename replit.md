## Project Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter (lightweight SPA routing)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + ShadCN UI components
- **State Management**: React Query + Custom hooks
- **Offline Storage**: IndexedDB via localforage
- **Charts**: Recharts for analytics visualizations
- **Markdown**: @uiw/react-md-editor

### Backend Stack
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon) for users, sessions, and data persistence
- **Authentication**: Replit Auth with OpenID Connect (Passport.js)
- **Session Management**: express-session with PostgreSQL storage
- **Storage**: Database storage with user-scoped queries
- **Validation**: Zod schemas
- **API**: RESTful endpoints with authentication middleware

### Key Design Decisions

#### Offline-First Architecture
- **Primary Storage**: IndexedDB via localforage (always available)
- **Backend**: Secondary storage for persistence and cross-device sync
- **Client IDs**: Generated with nanoid() and preserved by server
- **Sync Queue**: Automatic processing when connection restored
- **Optimistic Updates**: All writes to IndexedDB immediately, sync in background

#### ID Reconciliation Strategy
- Client generates IDs using nanoid() before any operation
- Server accepts client-provided `id`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt` fields
- PUT routes validate only required fields to allow queued updates
- Sync queue uses shared db instance for proper item removal
- No duplicate entries, no ID mismatches, no stuck operations

## API Endpoints

All endpoints require authentication and are scoped by userId for data isolation. Client-generated IDs are preserved for offline-first sync.

### Authentication
- `GET /api/login` - Initiate OAuth login flow
- `GET /api/callback` - OAuth callback handler
- `GET /api/logout` - Logout and clear session
- `GET /api/auth/user` - Get current authenticated user

### Journals
- `GET /api/journals` - Fetch all journal entries
- `GET /api/journals/:id` - Fetch single entry
- `POST /api/journals` - Create entry (accepts id, createdAt, updatedAt)
- `PUT /api/journals/:id` - Update entry
- `DELETE /api/journals/:id` - Delete entry

### Projects
- `GET /api/projects` - Fetch all projects (user-scoped)
- `GET /api/projects/:id` - Fetch single project (user-scoped)
- `POST /api/projects` - Create project (accepts id, createdAt, updatedAt)
- `PUT /api/projects/:id` - Update project (user-scoped)
- `DELETE /api/projects/:id` - Delete project (user-scoped)

### Profile
- `GET /api/profile` - Get user's profile
- `POST /api/profile` - Create/update user profile

## Custom Hooks

### useAuth()
Returns: `{ user, isAuthenticated, isLoading }`
- Checks authentication status via `/api/auth/user`
- Provides current user information
- Used for route protection and conditional rendering

### useJournals()
Returns: `{ journals, isLoading, createJournal, updateJournal, deleteJournal, isCreating, isUpdating }`
- Manages journal entries in IndexedDB
- Queues operations for backend sync
- Provides optimistic updates

### useProjects()
Returns: `{ projects, isLoading, createProject, updateProject, deleteProject, isCreating, isUpdating }`
- Manages projects in IndexedDB
- Queues operations for backend sync
- Provides optimistic updates

### useSyncQueue()
- Monitors online/offline status
- Processes queued operations when online
- Uses shared db instance for proper queue drainage
- Invalidates React Query cache after sync

## Development Guidelines

### Running the Project
```bash
npm run dev  # Starts both frontend (Vite) and backend (Express)
```

### Adding New Features
1. Define schema in `shared/schema.ts` with Zod validation
2. Update storage interface in `server/storage.ts`
3. Add API routes in `server/routes.ts` with proper validation
4. Create custom hook in `client/src/hooks/` for offline-first operations
5. Build UI components using ShadCN + Tailwind
6. Follow design_guidelines.md for consistent styling

### Offline-First Patterns
- Always write to IndexedDB first
- Queue operations in `db.addToSyncQueue()`
- Server accepts client IDs to prevent duplicates
- Extract only required fields in PUT routes for validation
- Use shared db instance for queue operations

## Testing

End-to-end testing verified:
- ✅ Landing page with branded login buttons (Google, GitHub, X, Apple)
- ✅ Protected route blocking for unauthenticated users
- ✅ Authentication flow with OAuth providers
- ✅ Complete data isolation between users
- ✅ Logout functionality and session cleanup
- ✅ Journal entry creation, editing, deletion
- ✅ Project creation with tech stack management
- ✅ Theme toggle persistence
- ✅ Search and tag filtering
- ✅ Analytics dashboard with live data
- ✅ All API endpoints returning correct data
- ✅ Offline-first architecture functioning properly

## Next Steps / Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:
- Service worker for true offline installability
- Export/import data functionality
- Rich text formatting options
- Collaborative features (sharing entries)
- Mobile app (React Native)
- Advanced analytics (streaks, goals)
- Cloud backup integration
- Automated testing suite

## Technical Notes

- **Authentication**: Replit Auth with OpenID Connect supporting Google, GitHub, X, and Apple
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon) with Drizzle ORM for type-safe queries
- **Sessions**: PostgreSQL-backed sessions with connect-pg-simple for reliability
- **Service Worker**: Configured via vite-plugin-pwa (requires additional setup for full offline caching)
- **Deployment**: Ready for deployment via Replit publishing

## Database Schema

### Users Table
- `id`: varchar (primary key, UUID from OAuth sub claim)
- `email`: varchar (unique)
- `firstName`, `lastName`: varchar
- `profileImageUrl`: varchar
- `createdAt`, `updatedAt`: timestamp

### Sessions Table
- `sid`: varchar (primary key)
