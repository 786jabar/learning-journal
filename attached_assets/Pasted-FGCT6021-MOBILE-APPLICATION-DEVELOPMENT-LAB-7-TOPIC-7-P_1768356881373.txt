FGCT6021 MOBILE APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT
LAB 7 – TOPIC 7 PWA
Submission
1. Submit your Learning Journal link (GitHub), your PythonAnywhere link and weekly journal 
entry on myUCA.
2. During the workshop, you will show your progress and share what you have learned.
Workshop Overview
You will extend your Learning Journal Progressive Web App (PWA) by applying PWA 
technologies to make it more reliable, installable, and interactive. This week’s focus is on using 
a manifest, creating a service worker, implementing caching with the Cache Storage API, and 
dynamically retrieving data with the Fetch API.
Your goal this week is to:
• Configure a manifest to make your app installable.
• Create a service worker to manage caching and offline access.
• Use the Cache Storage API and Fetch API to handle dynamic data.
• Explore and implement at least one extra feature that enhances the PWA experience.
• Modify your HTML and flask_app.py to integrate these PWA features with your existing 
backend.
This builds on your previous work with Flask, PythonAnywhere, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, 
now extending the Learning Journal into a more robust, offline-capable, and app-like 
experience.
Goal
Enhance your Learning Journal PWA with PWA technologies to improve usability, reliability, 
and offline capabilities, while maintaining dynamic data integration through Flask.
All files should be committed to your GitHub repository so progress is visible and version￾controlled.
What to Do
The following tasks are suggestions. You may adapt them as appropriate to your own design.
Folder and File Structure
Flask works best with its conventional static/ and templates/ folders. A suggested structure:
/mysite
 flask_app.py Main Flask backend file
 /templates 
index.html HTML pages served by Flask
journal.html
about.html
projects.html
 /static Client-side assets
/css Stylesheets
 style.css
/js JavaScript files
 script.js
 sw.js Service worker
/images Media assets
 icon.png
manifest.json HTML pages served by Flask
 /backend Backend data files
reflections.json JSON file storing reflections
Manifest
1. Consider creating a manifest file, manifest.json, to make your app installable.
2. Include fields that support installability, such as app name, short name, icons, start URL, 
display mode, and theme colours.
3. You may also explore optional fields such as orientation, description, or categories to 
enhance the app experience.
4. Linking the manifest in your HTML <head> can allow your app to be installed on desktop or 
mobile for testing purposes.
Service Worker & Dynamic Data Handling
1. Create a service worker file, sw.js, to manage caching and offline access.
2. Decide which static assets, pages, or backend data should be cached.
3. Explore ways to dynamically retrieve and display backend data using web APIs, such as 
Cache Storage API or Fetch API, in combination with your service worker.
4. Modify your HTML and flask_app.py as needed to integrate dynamic data fetching, 
ensuring the interface updates when new reflections are added.
5. Consider strategies for updating the UI when the app returns online after being offline.
6. Test your app in both online and offline modes to ensure a reliable experience
