## TIPS FOR RECORDING

1. Speak slowly and clearly - viewers may be non-native English speakers
2. Pause briefly when navigating to let the page load
3. Move your mouse smoothly - jerky movements are distracting
4. Zoom in on important UI elements if needed
5. Have sample data ready - empty screens look unprofessional
6. Test everything before recording - nothing worse than a bug mid-demo
7. Use keyboard shortcuts where possible - looks more professional
8. Mention file names/locations when discussing code
9. Stay positive even if something goes wrong - just explain and move on
10. End confidently - summarize key points and thank the viewer</div>
